                    DOOM was born in London, England and shortly moved to Long Island, New York. His first music debut was with a group named KMD. In this group, he went by the
                    name <strong>Zev Love X</strong>. It was not until 1997 that Daniel donned his notorious mask, based on the cartoon super-villian <strong>Doctor Doom</strong>. It was around this time that 
                    <strong>MF DOOM</strong> released his debut album under this alias titled <em>Operation: Doomsday</em>.
