                    This is a short paragraph about me! I graduated in december with a degree in International Business. My minor
                    was Chinese. I found the academic side of Business very interesting however the job market was rough and I couldn't
                    find a job that peaked my interest. Therefore, I decided to join the coding bootcamp at UNCC to pursue a far more interesting
                    and rewarding career.
